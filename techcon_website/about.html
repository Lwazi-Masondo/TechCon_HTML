        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          TechCon began in 1996 in New Orleans, Louisiana, as a modest gathering
          of semiconductor professionals and researchers. Over the years, it has
          evolved into a premier innovation conference, attracting industry
          leaders, innovators, and investors from around the globe. The
          conference has been hosted in various cities across the United States,
          reflecting its growing prominence and the expanding interests of the
          tech community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2024, TechCon was held from September 8–10 at the Renaissance Hotel
          in Austin, Texas. The event featured keynotes, technical sessions, and
          networking opportunities, with highlights including Deirdre Hanford's
          keynote on R&D's role in sustainability and a diverse lineup of over
          200 SRC Research Scholars.
        </p>
        <p>
          TechCon's evolution reflects the dynamic nature of the technology
          industry. From its origins focusing on semiconductor research, it has
          expanded to encompass a broad range of topics, including artificial
          intelligence, sustainability, and career agility. The conference
          continues to serve as a platform for knowledge exchange,
          collaboration, and the celebration of innovation and excellence in
          technology.
